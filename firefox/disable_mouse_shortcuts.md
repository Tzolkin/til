## Disable mouse back and forward shortcuts

```
1. Type about:config into Firefox's address bar
2. If you haven't previously disabled it, a warning page about the dangers of changing settings that you don't understand will pop up. Read it, then click "I accept the risk!"
3. In the about:config search bar, search for mousebutton. You should find two preferences, mousebutton.4th.enabled and mousebutton.5th.enabled, both set to true. Double click each of these to set them to false.
```
